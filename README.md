# maker-snippets

This project is here to house a small collection of random projects and snippets of code as I learn, develop and play with hardware.

These will vary broadly between the languages that these devices support, but most likely:

- C
- Micropython
- ASM

Projects will be managed in a folder structure to identify the hardware being developed on
